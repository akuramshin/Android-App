# Android-App
A group project from a university course.

For this project we created an Android app consisting of a login/registration screen, several minigames, a statistics page, and a leaderboard screen.

In this project we demonstrated how to seperate front and back end by incorporating the Model-View-Presenter architectural pattern. To reduce coupling and increase cohesion between our classes we employed the SOLID design principles. Organize the classes and packages by the Ports and Adapters architecture.

Since the database was not the main focus of this project, we needed a quick and easy way to store user data. For this project we decided on the SharedPreferences APIs provided by Android.

The project development was split up into two phases. The first phase was meant to display the basic functionality of login/registration and the bare bones games. During phase 2 we polished up the visual appeal and flow of the User Interface, and removed various code smells.
